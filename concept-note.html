        <strong>Concept Note — “Qubit capacity” as a banner for quantum capacity &amp; risk</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="meta">
        Version 1.0 — descriptive framing note for policy-makers, public agencies, Boards,
        quantum vendors, hyperscalers, systemic financial institutions and consulting / audit firms.
        This document is not legal, financial, tax, investment, security or scientific advice and
        does not describe a product or service.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Purpose of QubitCapacity.com</h2>
      <p>
        QubitCapacity.com is a <strong>naming asset</strong> for the question:
        <strong>“What quantum capacity do we actually have, and who controls it?”</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is meant as a <strong>neutral, descriptive .com banner</strong> for initiatives that
        seek to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>measure and compare <strong>usable quantum capacity</strong> across providers and geographies;</li>
        <li>connect quantum capacity with <strong>risk, resilience and supervision</strong> questions;</li>
        <li>offer decision-makers a <strong>simple phrase</strong> for a technically complex topic.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. From qubit counts to “qubit capacity”</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Technical background</h3>
      <p>
        Public communication around quantum computing has often focused on
        <strong>headline qubit counts</strong>. For serious risk, policy and investment decisions,
        this is not enough. What matters is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the difference between <strong>physical and logical qubits</strong>;</li>
        <li>error rates, connectivity, coherence times and <strong>circuit depth</strong>;</li>
        <li>how much <strong>useful logical work</strong> can be performed before decoherence;</li>
        <li>the maturity of the surrounding <strong>software and control stack</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        “Qubit capacity” is a convenient umbrella to refer to this
        <strong>effective, usable capacity</strong>, rather than just hardware counts.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Why capacity matters beyond hype</h3>
      <p>
        For governments, supervisors, large institutions and hyperscalers, quantum capacity
        is relevant in at least three ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>strategic autonomy</strong> and dependence on external providers;</li>
        <li><strong>risk of disruption</strong> (for example, Q-Day narratives and PQC roadmaps);</li>
        <li><strong>allocation of public and private R&amp;D resources</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A structured view of qubit capacity helps separate <strong>signal from hype</strong>
        and provides a more grounded basis for dialogue between technical teams and
        decision-makers.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Possible roles for an acquirer</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on the profile of the acquirer, QubitCapacity.com can serve as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a <strong>public-facing index or observatory</strong> tracking quantum capacity
          across providers, countries or sectors;
        </li>
        <li>
          a <strong>national quantum capacity assessment programme</strong> banner,
          supporting policy and industrial strategy;
        </li>
        <li>
          a <strong>neutral SaaS front-door</strong> for CISO / CTO / CRO dashboards
          assessing quantum exposure and PQC readiness;
        </li>
        <li>
          a <strong>shared label for alliances</strong> between quantum vendors, hyperscalers, banks
          and infrastructure operators.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In all cases, the domain is intended to remain a <strong>descriptive category name</strong>,
        not a brand that implies regulatory status or guarantee.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Board-level and supervisory questions</h2>
      <p>
        For Boards, regulators and supervisors, the “qubit capacity” angle creates a
        small set of focused questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How much <strong>usable quantum capacity</strong> do we depend on, directly or indirectly?</li>
        <li>How concentrated is that capacity across <strong>providers and jurisdictions</strong>?</li>
        <li>What is our <strong>governance model</strong> around quantum risk and PQC?</li>
        <li>Which organisations are in a position to <strong>aggregate and interpret</strong> these signals?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A domain such as QubitCapacity.com can serve as a <strong>stable reference point</strong>
        for these questions, even as the technical landscape evolves.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Positioning and red lines</h2>
      <p>
        To remain safe, credible and compatible with regulatory expectations, use of
        QubitCapacity.com should respect clear boundaries:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          it should <strong>not be presented as an official regulator, supervisor or intelligence body</strong>;
        </li>
        <li>
          it should not claim access to <strong>classified or non-public sources</strong>
          beyond what the acquirer legitimately uses elsewhere;
        </li>
        <li>
          it should not give the impression that quantum risk is <strong>fully quantified or solved</strong>;
        </li>
        <li>
          any indices, dashboards or standards published under this banner must clearly identify
          the <strong>responsible organisation</strong> and its methodology;
        </li>
        <li>
          the site must avoid offering <strong>regulated advisory or ratings</strong> unless
          the acquirer is duly authorised to do so, in which case this should be stated under
          its own name, not the previous owner’s.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Relationship with other systemic capacity concepts</h2>
      <p>
        “Qubit capacity” sits naturally alongside other systemic capacity notions such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>compute solvency</strong> (access to critical compute and infrastructure);</li>
        <li><strong>CO₂ capacity</strong> (emissions budgets and decarbonisation pathways);</li>
        <li><strong>model sovereignty</strong> (control over key models and datasets).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For an acquirer managing a broader portfolio of digital, climate and risk assets,
        QubitCapacity.com can help <strong>connect quantum-specific questions</strong>
        with a more general narrative on <strong>capacity, solvency and resilience</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Why a dedicated “QubitCapacity” label matters</h2>
      <p>
        Many quantum initiatives are currently described in terms of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>hardware generations and roadmaps;</li>
        <li>abstract “quantum advantage” statements;</li>
        <li>isolated proof-of-concept announcements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A banner centred on <strong>capacity</strong> pushes the conversation towards:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>what capacity is concretely available, to whom, and under which conditions;</li>
        <li>how it is <strong>governed, supervised and stress-tested</strong>;</li>
        <li>how it fits into <strong>risk, security and resilience frameworks</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        QubitCapacity.com gives this agenda a <strong>memorable and neutral name</strong>,
        suitable for long-term use in reports, speeches, requests for proposals,
        international collaborations and market communication.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Summary for decision-makers</h2>
      <p>
        QubitCapacity.com should be viewed as a <strong>strategic naming and narrative asset</strong>
        for organisations that want to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          structure and communicate a serious programme around <strong>quantum capacity and risk</strong>;
        </li>
        <li>
          provide a <strong>single, neutral entry point</strong> for stakeholders navigating a noisy field;
        </li>
        <li>
          connect technical progress in quantum computing with <strong>governance, supervision
          and systemic risk</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The intrinsic value of the domain will ultimately depend on the <strong>quality,
        integrity and seriousness</strong> of the initiatives carried under this name.
        Its role is to offer a <strong>clear, neutral and defensible label</strong> for the
        emerging topic of “qubit capacity”.
